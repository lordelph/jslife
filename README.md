jslife kata
===========

This started out as a 'mass pairing' exercise at the http://devcycles.net/summer/
conference. The idea was to team up with a random stranger and write
Conway's Game of Life together in 30 minutes as a 'code kata'

I teamed up with Phil Rodgers, who serendipitously has a family connection with
John Conway. We split the work between the engine and the UI, and 25 minutes
later, we had a glider crawling across a web page.

That code is in kata01 - it's not pretty. I realised what a crutch it is to
hit Google for things I don't do regularly - silly things like the order of
parameters in setTimeout, or the fact that I meant to use setInterval.

This was the first time I'd tried a 'code kata', and it was an eye opening experience.

So I will continue and see what I learn along the way...
