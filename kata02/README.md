===================
This took a bit longer as I got hung up on the state transition - the mistake
I made was properly copying the new state from the old state, so there's
not a huge amount of clarity.

There's more structure with the code essentially a jQuery plugin, and the
rendering happens immediately so a bigger grid would be possible.

Learned that JS arrays can't be deep copied
